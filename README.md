Personal implementation of libft. Do not use for libft-start-project at 42Cursus.

This repository contains my personal library of functions. 
I'm trying to make it well structured, extensible and flexible for every use. 
All functions must be considered incomplete, although perhaps some can be used without problems. 
Work is ongoing.
